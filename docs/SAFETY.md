# Safety & Consent Guardrails (Baseline)

This starter is designed to avoid “dependency” mechanics.

## Always
- Clear disclosure: user is chatting with an AI.
- No exclusivity pressure (“only I understand you”, “don’t leave me”, guilt).
- No manipulation to keep user engaged.
- User controls: view/edit/delete memories; delete account.

## Modes (recommended)
- Default tone: friendly/supportive
- Flirty: opt-in, reversible
- Adult/explicit: NOT implemented in this starter. Requires:
  - verified age gating
  - jurisdiction review
  - robust moderation and reporting
  - explicit consent flows

## Crisis routing
If user expresses self-harm intent, the assistant should respond with support and encourage contacting local emergency services and crisis lines.

## Data minimization
Store only what you need. Avoid storing sensitive personal data unless essential. Provide export and delete.
