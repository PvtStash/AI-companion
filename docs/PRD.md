# MVP PRD — Companion App (PG-13 default)

## Goal
Ship a mobile-first companion chat app that feels consistent and “remembering” while remaining transparent, consent-first, and non-manipulative.

## Non-goals (MVP)
- Real-time voice
- Image generation
- Social feed / community
- Adult/explicit content (requires separate compliance and age verification design)

## Core features
1. Text chat
2. Persona basics (name + tone sliders)
3. Structured memory (editable)
4. Periodic recaps (weekly)
5. Push notification scaffolding (MVP: local stub)

## Monetization (later)
- Free tier: limited messages/day
- Paid: higher limits + advanced personas + voice

## Success metrics
- D1/D7 retention
- Avg. sessions/user/day
- Memory edit usage (trust indicator)
- Churn reasons (qualitative)

## UX screens
- Auth
- Companion create
- Chat
- Memories
- Settings (tone sliders, boundaries)
- Data controls (export/delete)
